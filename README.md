Developed using C# and Unity

Asteroid Evasion is a space-flight simulator built in Unity 5.5. The goal is to navigate the ship through an asteroid field while avoiding collisions for as long as possible. The player must steer using the mouse X and Y motions, which use the Unity Rigid-Body physics to apply force and torque to the ship. The longer the player survives, the higher their score will be.
